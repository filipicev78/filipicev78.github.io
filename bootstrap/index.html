                    made a shield crest with 4 symbols of myself. I am going to talk about the lion symbol on my shield crest. The lion in my shield symbolizes confidence , as lion are often portrayed as “kings “ of the jungle. Lions are predators and attack their pray, just as I beileive that i “attack” secarios in my life with confidence. One example of this is when I ran to be the sports and athletics chair as a freshman. As a freshman and underclassmen people told me I shouldn’t run as I wouldn’t have a chance to win, and their had not been a slc elect ever. While this gave me pause I was confident in my abilities and decided to run for the position. I spent time to make a great video and ran for the position. I had to put myself out their to the whole school with my video. I ended up winning the vote becoming the first underclassman to be elected. I also show confidence on the sports field especially frisbee, going for every disc with full effort and confidence. My coaches have told me that I play “ like I think im the best on the field”. In the classroom my teachers have told me I have the confidence to always “contribute to the class and speak publically” . On the flip side I have been told I’m over-confident before by peers however I think that confidence and attacking life like a lion is present in all aspects of my life. This is why I chose the lion symbol to symbolize me.
