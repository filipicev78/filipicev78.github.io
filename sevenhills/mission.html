            <h2> History  </h2>
            <p style = "padding-left: 6%; font-size: 20px;">
                Seven Hills Ultimate Club was founded in 2015 by Shannon O’Malley, Alyssa Weatherford, and Sarah Griffith -- three long-time Seattle Riot players and Seattle youth ultimate coaches. However, club youth ultimate in Seattle has a long history. Both Shannon and Alyssa were coached in an earlier program called MoHo, and all three Seven Hills founders coached in the Fryz program that preceded Seven Hills.
            </p>
            <p style = "padding-left: 6%; font-size: 20px;">

                When the Fryz program came to an end, Shannon, Sarah, and Alyssa had a vision for filling that void with a club that: 1. Brought together youth players from all across the Seattle area to train and compete at a high level, and 2. To do so in a way that was equitable and accessible for all players.
            </p>
            <p style = "padding-left: 6%; font-size: 20px;">
             
                 The core values of the Seven Hills program are: Character, Opportunity, and Growth. We firmly believe that on-field technical skills alone are not what great players are made of. At the highest levels of our sport, everyone can throw well, play strong defense, or cut effectively. We believe that what distinguishes great players from good ones are traits like work ethic, resilience, self-awareness, commitment, drive to improve, humility, and being a supportive teammate. When we think about what makes an “exceptional ultimate player,” these competitor & teammate skills combine with on-field technical skills to form equal halves of a whole. At Seven Hills, we’re looking for players who want to grow and excel in both. Therefore, you could be the fastest defender at tryouts, or have the longest flick huck, and still not meet our standard of an “exceptional ultimate player.”
