            Benita learned to play ultimate in 2005 during her junior year of high school; the metro Portland schools scrimmaged each other weekly. She played at the University of Puget Sound, captaining for two years. She's played a lot of mixed league, dabbled in club (including a year with Schwa and most recently, Mint), and is an avid goaltimate fan. She coached three years for Pacific Lutheran University Reign Women. As a coach, she enjoys working alongside her players to try new things, grind through challenges, and grow as holistic athletes.

            I started playing frisbee at Pinehurst K-8 and have found a hidden love for the sport so I kept playing through high school at Rainier Beach. I played 3 years of under 20 during that time. I have just finished my first year with the University of Washington Sundodger.
